# BIOC470FINALPROJECT
Stochastic Repressilator

Malvika Govil and Jennifer Carson-GonzÃ¡lez -> Final Project SRC for Repressilator. Run "NaiveRepressilators" and "SpongeRepressilators" in order to simulate the 2000 paper repressilator and the 2016 paper repressilator, respectively. (using parameters from "Synchronous long-term oscillations in a synthetic gene circuit" URL: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/full/nature19841.html#bx1)
